The chief Intereſt of Man; Or, A Diſcourſe of RELIGION, Clearly demonſtrating The Equity of the Prec
1. THE PREFACE To the Reader.

#####Body#####

    _ SECTION. I. The Practical Atheiſt a greater wonder than the Speculative Atheiſt; the unreaſonableneſs of ſuch as profeſſing Religion, do yet neglect the commands thereof, and deſpiſe ſuch as deſire to be found in a ſtrict obſervance of them.

    _ SECT. II. The equity of Gods commands: Love (which is the fulfilling of the Law) founded on Gods goodneſs, Patience, Bounty. Fear (which with that obſervance that is the effect of it, is the whole Duty of Man) founded on his Power and Wiſdom: ratio rei, or reaſon it ſelf the ground of ſuch things as are of natural right: Gods ſoveraignty the ground of ſuch things as are of poſitive right.

    _ SECT. III. The advantage which Men have by Religion in reſpect of their good name, honour being both a moral and a natural effect of vertue and holineſſe. The Hypocriſie of ſome that profeſſe Chriſtianity, an argument of the excellency of it. Shame the preſent reward of ſin. None dare ſpeak againſt holineſs or holy men as ſuch.

    _ SECT. IV. How much Godlineſſe conduceth to the preſerving and increaſe of Mens Eſtates, which Sin doth like a Canker, waſt and conſume. An illuſtration of Jer. 17.11. and Hoſ. 9.11. Objections anſwered, which Men make from that Juſtice and Charity which Religion obliges Men to, and from thoſe expenſes and loſſes which it expoſes them to, as alſo from experience and daily obſervation.

    _ SECT. V. The influence which Religion hath even upon our bodies, how far it conduceth to our health. Diſeaſes of the body ordinarily proceed from the diſtempers of the Soul. That Temperance, Diligence in our callings and moderation of our paſſions, which the Goſpel requires and teaches, is the beſt remedy againſt them.

    _ SECT. VI. Religion forbids us not any pleaſures which are agreeable to nature, reaſon, or Mans own intereſt. None can more freely enjoy pleaſures than a Godly Man.

    _ SECT. VII. The advantage which we have by Religion in reſpect of our Souls. Firſt, in being thereby reſtored to the image of God, and that ſpiritual beauty which hath been defaced by ſin.

    _ SECT. IX. Tranquility of mind the priviledge of the Godly Man. A due ordering of the affections, not a ſtoical Apathy neceſſary thereto. Peace of Conſcience unknown to the Heathen Philoſophers, and attainable only by true Religion. Objectionsgrounded on the moroſeneſs, and inward troubles of Chriſtians anſwered.

    _ SECT. IX. The reward which Godly Men have after this life, the chief advantage of Religion. The excellency thereof demonſtrated from Scripture, from the ſatisfaction which the Angels have in it, from the glory which wicked Men enjoy in this World, from the ſweet fore-taſts which Godly men have of it in this life. Wherein it conſiſts, the glory of the body, the happineſs of the Soul, in the enjoyment of God, in communion with the whole number of perfected Saints, and that for ever.

    _ SECT. X. The neceſſity of holineſs to ſalvation, proved by many plain Scriptures. Objections anſwered. The imprudence of being but formal half Chriſtians, and the advantages that ſtict ſerious Chriſtians have above ſuch.

    _ SECT. XI. The miſery of wicked Men after this life demonſtrated from Scriptures, from the ſufferings of Godly Men here in this World, from terrors of conſcience in good and bad, from the Devils trembling at the thoughts of it, which they have not ſo much reaſon for as Man. The puniſhment of loſſe with the aggravations of it. The puniſhment of ſenſe exquiſite, without allay or intermiſſion, without end.

    _ SECT. XII. How much Religion conduces to the good of humane Societies. And firſt, of Families, preſcribing ſuch rules to all therein, as well obſerved, would make them happy in each other.

    _ SECT. XIII. How far Religion advances the happineſs of Kingdoms and Common-wealths, not only naturally, as it preſcribes the beſt Laws, and rules to all ſorts of Perſons, and keeps Men within the bounds of their duty; But morally, as it brings down bleſſings, keeps off judgements. The falſe accuſations which Chriſtians have lain under in all Ages. Julians wicked policy.

    _ SECT. XIV. An enquiry into the cauſes, why Religion is ſo much neglected. The remoter cauſes the corruption of Mans nature, the malice and power of the Devil, the nearer cauſe, the prevalenccy of ſence againſt Faith and reaſon, which is removed by ſhewing in how many in ſtances of our Lives, we do by reaſon correct the errors of ſenſe.

    _ SECT. XV. Inconſiderateneſſe, another great cauſe of Atheiſm, againſt which the beſt remedies are a ſerious apprehenſion of the great moment, and importance of ſpiritual things, frequent reading and hearing the word of God, Chriſtian communion and conference about matters of Religion, mutual admonition. The prevalency of evil cuſtoms and habits, the folly of deferring repentance.

    _ SECT. XVI. Objections, from differences in Religion anſwered, though we could not be fully aſſured that the Chriſtian Religion is true, yet it would be our wiſdom to obſerve the Rules and Precepts of it. The proofs which ſome have of the truth of Chriſtian Religion, clearer than thoſe which ſome deſire to have, & clearer than any produced for the truth of any other Religion. Objections from the improbability and ſeeming contradiction of many things in Scripture anſwered. Notwithſtanding the difference amongſt Chriſtians, all of them are agreed, in ſo much as may ſerve for the well ordering of our converſations.
